# Jeff's Web Development Portfolio

[Check it out!](https://jeffellingham.github.io)

I created this portfolio site as a practical first project to learn the foundational tools HTML/CSS while also building a home to showcase every project I did thereafter. It was the project I worked on throughout the introductory course on HTML/CSS in CareerFoundry's Full-stack Web Development bootcamp. 

I have definite plans going forward to create a new portfolio incorporating the things I learn in future courses of the bootcamp (JavaScript, React.js, etc.). However, I'm not sure whether I'll update **this** portfolio or preserve this one and create a new one from scratch. Though I'm leaning towards new.

## Technical aspects

Tools/resources used and learned:
- HTML5
- CSS3
  - Animations and Transitions
  - Responsive design and Media queries
  - Layouts
    - CSS Grid
    - Flexbox
  - Pre/Postprocessors
    - SASS/SCSS
    - Autoprefixer
- Git and GitHub, obviously, and GitHub Pages

Lastly, I'd like to thank CareerFoundry, my tutor Jubril, and my mentor Paulo, for helping me create this portfolio and take the first step in finally making my dream of being a coder/programmer a reality!

There are too many other people and companies that taught me things large and small along the way to name them all, and I know many more will be added as I continue to learn, though a few stood out during this beginning phase:

- [Wes bos--both his tutorials and podcast with Scott Tolinski](https://wesbos.com/courses)
- [The creators of the codepip games](https://codepip.com)
- [Kamran Ahmed for his roadmaps and additional resources](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [Scrimba--both the website and their amazing podcast](https://scrimba.com)
- And to the countless others I didn't mention, anyone who has created free content or tools to help beginners like me: **THANK YOU**!
